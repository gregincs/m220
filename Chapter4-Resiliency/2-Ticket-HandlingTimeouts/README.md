### Ticket: Handling Timeouts

Problem:

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to modify the connection information for MongoClient to set a write concern timeout of **2500** milliseconds.

The MongoClient in mflix.config.MongoDBConfiguration is initialized in the **mongoClient** bean method. There are a few other details in the [Mongo Client section of the Java Driver documentation](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.9/driver/tutorials/connect-to-mongodb/) for your reference.

Aside from the write concern timeout, you are also tasked to set the connectTimeoutMS configuration option to **2000** milliseconds. This option should be set in the connection string. Check [MongoDB URI options reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/#urioption.connectTimeoutMS) for more information.

The unit test TimeoutsTest.java will be asserting that these two configuration options are correctly set.

**Testing and Running the Application**

If the application is already running, **stop the application** and run the unit tests for this ticket by executing the following command:

mvn test -Dtest=TimeoutsTest

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

mvn spring-boot:run

Or run the Application.java class from your IDE.

Now proceed to the [status page](http://localhost:5000/status) to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

To have the application use the changes that you implemented for this ticket, make sure to **restart the application** after you completed those changes. Also, only refresh the status page to see the new results of the tests, after the application has been restarted.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for **Timeouts**?
